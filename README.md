# Python-OpenGL

This repository contains my working tests on OpenGL API that I'm playing with during its studying. 

There're two main folders with projects using standard GLFW or QtOpenGL from PySide2 framework.

Every project is a one-file script. Each ao them could be rewritten later.

**!! WORK IS STILL IN PROGRESS !!**
